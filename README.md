# RFID & NFC Communication

## NFC (Near Field Communication)

NFC is a way for two devices very close to each other to communicate. 

If you’ve ever used a mobile payments app like Apple Pay or Google Pay, or a contactless bank card, you’ve used NFC technology. NFC is a proximity-based wireless communication standard. Unlike Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, NFC interaction is limited to an extremely short range.
