## RFID

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) 

## NFC 

NFC (Near Field Communication) is a way for two devices very close to each other to communicate. 

If you’ve ever used a mobile payments app like Apple Pay or Google Pay, or a contactless bank card, you’ve used NFC technology. NFC is a proximity-based wireless communication standard. Unlike Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, NFC interaction is limited to an extremely short range. 

It is an extension of RFID, so anything you can do with RFID you can do with NFC. 

## Which one should I use? RFID or NFC?

It will depend on the range, functionality, and use you want to attain.
